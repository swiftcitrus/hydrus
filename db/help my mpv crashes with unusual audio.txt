If your audio driver is ASIO or WASAPI and hydrus crashes as soon as you load a audio/video in mpv, please add these lines to your mpv.conf:

ao=wasapi
audio-fallback-to-null=yes

If you have no audio devices on your computer and hydrus crashes as soon as you load audio/video in mpv, just add the fallback line:

audio-fallback-to-null=yes
